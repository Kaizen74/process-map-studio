# API Contract
*Any change here requires updating BOTH backend and frontend in the SAME increment — never leave them misaligned at a checkpoint. Edit this file first (PRD §6.1 rule 12).*

Base path `/api`. JSON unless noted. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

Standard error shape for every endpoint (PRD §4):
```json
{"error": {"code": "PUBLISH_BLOCKED", "message": "Plain-language explanation", "details": {}}}
```

Endpoints are added here as each phase builds them. The full planned list is PRD §4.

Every response carries an `X-Request-ID` header. Error bodies also include it as `details.request_id`, so the screen's **Copy details** can give "error code · request ID" for bug reports.

## System

### GET /api/health
Purpose: lets the launcher and tests confirm the app is running.
Request: none.
Response `200`:
```json
{"status": "ok", "app_version": "0.1.0", "prd_version": "1.5"}
```
Used by: `scripts/start.py` (waits for it before opening the browser). No screen uses it yet; the P0a placeholder page is static.

### Unknown `/api/...` path
Response `404` in the standard error shape with code `NOT_FOUND`.

## Static files (not part of `/api`)
`GET /` and any other non-API path serve the built frontend (`frontend/dist/index.html` and its assets). If the frontend has not been built yet, `GET /` returns a plain page saying "Run Setup first".

## Settings (PRD §3.4, §5.4) — phase P0b

Settings are stored in the private `.env` file in the app folder (never in the database or git) through `services/settings_store.py`, and take effect without restarting. For each setting, a non-empty value in `.env` wins, then the computer's environment variable, then the default in PRD §3.4. The API key is **never** returned: responses carry only `key_set` and `key_last4`.

### Settings object (returned by every Settings endpoint below)
```json
{"owner_name": "Owner", "model": "claude-opus-5-5", "effort": "high",
 "verifier_enabled": true, "web_research_enabled": false,
 "key_set": true, "key_last4": "x9Q2"}
```
`key_last4` is `""` when no key is set.

### GET /api/settings
Request: none. Response `200`: the settings object.
Errors: `500 IO` if the `.env` file can't be read.
Used by: Settings screen (`features/settings`), Home first-run checklist (`features/home`), via `hooks/useSettings`.

### PUT /api/settings/profile
Request: `{"owner_name": "Eric Yim"}` — 1 to 80 characters after trimming, no line breaks.
Response `200`: the settings object.
Errors: `422 VALIDATION` with a plain message (e.g. "Please enter your name (up to 80 characters)."); `500 IO` if `.env` can't be written.
Used by: Settings screen, "Your name" card.

### PUT /api/settings/key
Request: `{"anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-..."}` — trimmed; must start with `sk-ant-`, no spaces or line breaks, 20 to 300 characters.
Response `200`: the settings object (masked: `key_set: true`, `key_last4`).
Errors: `422 VALIDATION` ("That doesn't look like a Claude API key. Keys start with sk-ant-. Copy it again from the Claude Console."); `500 IO`. Error bodies never echo the key.
Used by: Settings screen, "Claude connection" card.
